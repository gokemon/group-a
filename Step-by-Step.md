# Step-by-Step #

This project is my recreation of my **Connector-Node** API for a clone of Medium.com, a social blogging site. Many other clones of facebook, twitter, and other popular sites are out there. 
I built mine with Mongo, Express and Node, as a MEN-stack CRUD-based API, for am Angular 2 front-end.

These will be the steps, that each person in a four person agile developer team would take to build the application.

For this demo, I use the terms, **TeamLead**, **Dev1**, **Dev2**, and **JrDev**. 

There are four groups, Group A-D so each of the four developers get to be the TeamLead on their own Group, and each will take on the role of Dev1, Dev2, and JrDev on each of the other teams.

When I am working on Group B's team, then I will be Dev1. When I am working on Group C's team, I will be Dev2, and thus on Group D, the JrDev.

We will use the code from [Connector-Node](https://github.com/gokemon/connector-node) and do compares on the branches to figure out the code changes between branches, and each developer work to recreate the code from their branch, and team, and we will round robin, so that way we incrementally make the changes needed. 

We will use the steps in the note.txt file for the steps in using Git and GitHub (I think).
