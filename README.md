This project is my recreation of my **Connector-Node** API for a clone of Medium.com, a social blogging site. Many other clones of facebook, twitter, and other popular sites are out there. 
I built mine with Mongo, Express and Node, as a MEN-stack CRUD-based API, for am Angular 2 front-end.


We are going to setup a simple layout method that has worked very well for MEN-stack CRUD-based API

We will build some folders;
\config
\models
\routes
\routes\api
